            "response": "Step 1: Unpolarized light is incident on the first polarizer, which will only allow light vibrating in one direction to pass through.\nStep 2: The transmitted light from the first polarizer will be linearly polarized.\nStep 3: This linearly polarized light is incident on the second polarizer, which has its transmission axis at a 45 degree angle to the first polarizer.\nStep 4: The intensity of light transmitted through a polarizer is given by Malus's Law: I = I\u2080cos\u00b2(\u03b8), where I\u2080 is the incident intensity and \u03b8 is the angle between the transmission axis and the direction of polarization.\nStep 5: Plugging in the values, we get I = I\u2080cos\u00b2(45\u00b0) = I\u2080(1/2).\nStep 6: Therefore, the transmitted light intensity through both polarizers is 50% of the incident intensity.\nthe answer is (C) 50%",
