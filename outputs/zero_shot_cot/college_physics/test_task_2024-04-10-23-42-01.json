            "response": "Step 1: The gravitational force between the satellite and the planet is given by F = G * (m * M) / R^2, where G is the gravitational constant.\nStep 2: The centripetal force required for the circular motion is given by F = m * v^2 / R, where v is the orbital velocity of the satellite.\nStep 3: Equating the gravitational force to the centripetal force, we get G * (m * M) / R^2 = m * v^2 / R.\nStep 4: Solving for v, we get v = sqrt(G * M / R).\nStep 5: The time required for one revolution is given by T = 2 * pi * R / v.\nStep 6: Substituting the expression for v, we get T = 2 * pi * R / sqrt(G * M / R).\nStep 7: Simplifying, we get T = 2 * pi * sqrt(R^3 / (G * M)).\nthe answer is (D) proportional to R^(3/2)",
