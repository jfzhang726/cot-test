In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4.

The angular magnification of the telescope is\n(A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy.

Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy. The answer is (B).\n        Q: Consider three identical, ideal capacitors. The first capacitor is charged to a voltage and then disconnected from the battery. The other two capacitors, initially uncharged and connected in series, are then connected across the first capacitor. What is the final voltage on the first capacitor?\n        Answer Choices: (A) V_0/5 (B) V_0/3 (C) V_0/2 (D) 2V_0/3\n        A: Let's think step by step. \n        ",
            "response": "When the first capacitor is disconnected from the battery, it retains its charge. When the other two capacitors are connected in series and then connected across the first capacitor, the total charge on the first capacitor must be shared among the three capacitors. Since they are identical, each capacitor will have 1/3 of the original charge. The final voltage on the first capacitor is proportional to the charge, so it will be 1/3 of the original voltage.

Lepton number must be conserved, meaning the total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons. If a muon decays into an electron and a single neutrino, the total lepton number would go from one to two, violating lepton number conservation. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: One end of a Nichrome wire of length 2L and cross-sectional area A is attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length L and cross- sectional area 2A. If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0 volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to\n(A) 2.4 V (B) 3.3 V (C) 4.5 V (D) 5.7 V\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end.

Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force.

            "response": "The maximum distance from the center of the turntable at which the coin will not slide can be found using the formula for centripetal force. The maximum static friction force is equal to the centripetal force required to keep the coin in circular motion. The centripetal force is given by F = mv^2/r, where m is the mass of the coin, v is the tangential velocity of the coin, and r is the distance from the center of the turntable. The maximum static friction force is given by fs = \u03bcsN, where \u03bcs is the coefficient of static friction and N is the normal force. Setting these two forces equal to each other, we get \u03bcsN = mv^2/r. Since N = mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, we can substitute this into the equation to get \u03bcsmg = mv^2/r. Solving for r, we get r = \u03bcsg/v^2. Converting the angular velocity of the turntable to linear velocity, we get v = 2\u03c0rN/60, where N is the revolutions per minute. Substituting this into the equation for r, we get r = \u03bcsg/(2\u03c0rN/60)^2. Solving for r, we get r = \u03bcsg/(4\u03c0^2r^2N^2/3600). Rearranging the equation, we get r^3 = \u03bcsg/(4\u03c0^2N^2/3600). Plugging in the values for \u03bcs, g, and N, we get r^3 = (0.30)(9.8)/(4\u03c0^2(33.3)^2/3600). Solving for r, we get r \u2248 0.048 m. Therefore, the answer is (B) 0.048 m.",

In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: The muon decays with a characteristic lifetime of about 10^-6 second into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of\n(A) charge (B) mass (C) energy and momentum (D) lepton number\nA: Let's think step by step. Lepton number must be conserved, meaning the total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons.

Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: The muon decays with a characteristic lifetime of about 10^-6 second into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of\n(A) charge (B) mass (C) energy and momentum (D) lepton number\nA: Let's think step by step. Lepton number must be conserved, meaning the total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons. If a muon decays into an electron and a single neutrino, the total lepton number would go from one to two, violating lepton number conservation. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: One end of a Nichrome wire of length 2L and cross-sectional area A is attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length L and cross- sectional area 2A. If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0 volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to\n(A) 2.4 V (B) 3.3 V (C) 4.5 V (D) 5.7 V\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end. So the voltage divider ratio is 1 / 5, meaning that the potential in the middle is 1.0 V + (8.0 V - 1.0 V) * 1/5 = 2.4 V.

The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy.

The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of\n(A) charge (B) mass (C) energy and momentum (D) lepton number\nA: Let's think step by step. Lepton number must be conserved, meaning the total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons. If a muon decays into an electron and a single neutrino, the total lepton number would go from one to two, violating lepton number conservation.

This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end.

The force due to the electric field is qE in the +x-direction, and the force due to the magnetic field is qvB in the +y-direction. Since the proton is moving in the +z-direction, the force due to the electric field must be balanced by the force due to the magnetic field. This means qE = qvB, or E = vB. Since v = sqrt(2qV/m), where m is the mass of the proton, we can see that E = sqrt(2qV/m) * B. If the potential difference is doubled to 2V, then the new electric field will be E' = sqrt(2q(2V)/m) * B = sqrt(4qV/m) * B = 2 * sqrt(2qV/m) * B = 2E.

Let's calculate the speed of sound at 20\u00b0C using the equation v = f\u03bb. Since the pipe is open at both ends, the fundamental frequency corresponds to a wavelength that is four times the length of the pipe. Therefore, \u03bb = 4L.

In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: The muon decays with a characteristic lifetime of about 10^-6 second into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of\n(A) charge (B) mass (C) energy and momentum (D) lepton number\nA: Let's think step by step. Lepton number must be conserved, meaning the total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons.

This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end. So the voltage divider ratio is 1 / 5, meaning that the potential in the middle is 1.0 V + (8.0 V - 1.0 V) * 1/5 = 2.4 V. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is\n(A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy. The answer is (B).\n        Q: A uniform solid disk starts from rest and rolls down an inclined plane without slipping. After some time, what fraction of the disk\u2019s total kinetic energy is rotational kinetic energy?\n        Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 1/3 (C) 1/2 (D) 2/3\n        A: Let's think step by step. \n        ",
            "response": "The total kinetic energy of the disk is the sum of its translational kinetic energy and its rotational kinetic energy. Since the disk is rolling without slipping, the velocity of the center of mass is related to the angular velocity by v = \u03c9r, where r is the radius of the disk. The total kinetic energy can be written as KE = 1/2 mv^2 + 1/2 I\u03c9^2, where I is the moment of inertia of the disk. Since the disk starts from rest, initially only rotational kinetic energy is zero. As the disk rolls down the incline, both translational and rotational kinetic energy increase. At some point, the rotational kinetic energy will be equal to the total kinetic energy, meaning that half of the total kinetic energy is rotational kinetic energy. The answer is (C).",

            "response": "The frequency of the siren heard by the driver is given by the Doppler effect equation: f' = f(v + vo) / (v + vs), where f is the frequency of the siren, v is the speed of sound, vo is the speed of the observer, and vs is the speed of the source. In this case, the driver is moving towards the wall, so the speed of the observer is negative. Plugging in the values, we get f' = 600 * (350 - 3.5) / (350 - 0) = 606 Hz. The answer is (B).",

In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: The muon decays with a characteristic lifetime of about 10^-6 second into an electron, a muon neutrino, and an electron antineutrino. The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of\n(A) charge (B) mass (C) energy and momentum (D) lepton number\nA: Let's think step by step. Lepton number must be conserved, meaning the total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons. If a muon decays into an electron and a single neutrino, the total lepton number would go from one to two, violating lepton number conservation. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: One end of a Nichrome wire of length 2L and cross-sectional area A is attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length L and cross- sectional area 2A. If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0 volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to\n(A) 2.4 V (B) 3.3 V (C) 4.5 V (D) 5.7 V\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end. So the voltage divider ratio is 1 / 5, meaning that the potential in the middle is 1.0 V + (8.0 V - 1.0 V) * 1/5 = 2.4 V.

Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy. The answer is (B).\n        Q: A net force F_A acts on object A, and a net force F_B acts on object B.

The angular magnification of the telescope is\n(A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation.

If a muon decays into an electron and a single neutrino, the total lepton number would go from one to two, violating lepton number conservation.

If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0 volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to\n(A) 2.4 V (B) 3.3 V (C) 4.5 V (D) 5.7 V\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end.

In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy.

The answer is (D).\n\nQ: One end of a Nichrome wire of length 2L and cross-sectional area A is attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length L and cross- sectional area 2A. If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0 volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to\n(A) 2.4 V (B) 3.3 V (C) 4.5 V (D) 5.7 V\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end. So the voltage divider ratio is 1 / 5, meaning that the potential in the middle is 1.0 V + (8.0 V - 1.0 V) * 1/5 = 2.4 V. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is\n(A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy. The answer is (B).\n        Q: The suspension cable of a 1,000 kg elevator snaps, sending the elevator moving downward through its shaft. The emergency brakes of the elevator stop the elevator shortly before it reaches the bottom of the shaft. If the elevator fell a distance of 100 m starting from rest, the heat that the brakes must dissipate to bring the elevator safely to rest is\n        Answer Choices: (A) 100 J (B) 1,000 J (C) 10,000 J (D) 1,000,000 J\n        A: Let's think step by step. \n        ",
            "response": "The potential energy of the elevator at the top of the shaft is mgh = 1,000 kg * 9.8 m/s^2 * 100 m = 980,000 J. This energy is converted into kinetic energy as the elevator falls, so the kinetic energy at the bottom of the shaft is also 980,000 J. To bring the elevator to rest, the brakes must dissipate this kinetic energy as heat. The answer is (D) 1,000,000 J.",

            "response": "The length contraction formula states that L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2), where L is the length measured by the observer, L0 is the proper length, v is the velocity of the object, and c is the speed of light. In this case, L = 60 cm and L0 = 100 cm (the proper length of a meterstick). Solving for v, we get v = sqrt(1 - (L/L0)^2) * c = sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) * c = 0.8c. Since the observer on Earth sees both spaceships approaching with equal speeds, the speed of each spaceship is half of 0.8c, which is 0.4c. The answer is (A).",

The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of\n(A) charge (B) mass (C) energy and momentum (D) lepton number\nA: Let's think step by step.

If the speed of sound is 350 m/s and the frequency of the siren is 600 Hz, the driver hears the echo at a frequency nearest to which of the following?\n        Answer Choices: (A) 588 Hz (B) 594 Hz (C) 600 Hz (D) 612 Hz\n        A: Let's think step by step. \n        ",
            "response": "The frequency of the siren heard by the driver is given by the Doppler effect equation: f' = f(v + vo) / (v + vs), where f is the frequency of the siren, v is the speed of sound, vo is the speed of the observer (in this case, the driver), and vs is the speed of the source (in this case, the wall). Since the wall is stationary, vs = 0. The driver is moving towards the wall, so vo = 3.5 m/s. Plugging in the values, we get f' = 600 * (350 + 3.5) / (350 + 0) = 600 * 353.5 / 350 = 604.2 Hz.

Since they move off at equal speeds, their kinetic energies are equal. The rest energy of the electron-positron pair is 2mc^2, where m is the mass of the electron. Therefore, the total energy after the interaction is 2mc^2 + 2(1/2)mv^2, where v is the speed of the electrons.

The muon is forbidden from decaying into an electron and just a single neutrino by the law of conservation of\n(A) charge (B) mass (C) energy and momentum (D) lepton number\nA: Let's think step by step. Lepton number must be conserved, meaning the total number of leptons minus the number of antileptons. If a muon decays into an electron and a single neutrino, the total lepton number would go from one to two, violating lepton number conservation. The answer is (D).\n\nQ: One end of a Nichrome wire of length 2L and cross-sectional area A is attached to an end of another Nichrome wire of length L and cross- sectional area 2A. If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0 volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to\n(A) 2.4 V (B) 3.3 V (C) 4.5 V (D) 5.7 V\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end. So the voltage divider ratio is 1 / 5, meaning that the potential in the middle is 1.0 V + (8.0 V - 1.0 V) * 1/5 = 2.4 V. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is\n(A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy. The answer is (B).\n        Q: A uniform solid disk starts from rest and rolls down an inclined plane without slipping. After some time, what fraction of the disk\u2019s total kinetic energy is rotational kinetic energy?\n        Answer Choices: (A) 1/4 (B) 1/3 (C) 1/2 (D) 2/3\n        A: Let's think step by step. \n        ",
            "response": "The total kinetic energy of the disk is the sum of its translational kinetic energy and its rotational kinetic energy. Since the disk is rolling without slipping, the rotational kinetic energy is equal to 1/2 * I * \u03c9^2, where I is the moment of inertia and \u03c9 is the angular velocity. The translational kinetic energy is equal to 1/2 * m * v^2, where m is the mass of the disk and v is the linear velocity. Since the disk is rolling without slipping, v = \u03c9 * r, where r is the radius of the disk.\n\nThe total kinetic energy is the sum of the translational and rotational kinetic energies, so the fraction of the total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is:\n\nRotational KE / Total KE = (1/2 * I * \u03c9^2) / (1/2 * m * v^2 + 1/2 * I * \u03c9^2)\n\nSince the disk is rolling without slipping, we can substitute v = \u03c9 * r into the equation:\n\nRotational KE / Total KE = (1/2 * I * \u03c9^2) / (1/2 * m * (\u03c9 * r)^2 + 1/2 * I * \u03c9^2)\n\nSimplifying the equation gives:\n\nRotational KE / Total KE = (1/2 * I * \u03c9^2) / (1/2 * m * \u03c9^2 * r^2 + 1/2 * I * \u03c9^2)\nRotational KE / Total KE = I / (m * r^2 + I)\n\nSince the disk is a solid disk, the moment of inertia I = 1/2 * m * r^2. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n\nRotational KE / Total KE = (1/2 * m * r^2) / (m * r^2 + 1/2 * m * r^2)\nRotational KE / Total KE = (1/2) / (3/2)\nRotational KE / Total KE = 1/3\n\nTherefore, the fraction of the disk's total kinetic energy that is rotational kinetic energy is 1/3.

In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy. The answer is (B).\n        Q: Under certain conditions, a beam of electrons impinging on a crystal surface will diffract and a scattering pattern of the beam can be obtained. What is the approximate kinetic energy of the electrons needed in order to see the pattern? (Assume the lattice spacing of the crystal to be 0.4 nm.)\n        Answer Choices: (A) 0.1 eV (B) 1 eV (C) 10 eV (D) 100 eV\n        A: Let's think step by step. \n        ",
            "response": "The condition for diffraction to occur is that the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons must be on the order of the lattice spacing of the crystal. The de Broglie wavelength is given by \u03bb = h / p, where p is the momentum of the electron. The kinetic energy of the electron is given by KE = p^2 / 2m, where m is the mass of the electron. Since the de Broglie wavelength is approximately equal to the lattice spacing, we can use the relation \u03bb = h / \u221a(2mKE) to find the kinetic energy needed. Plugging in the values, we get KE \u2248 10 eV. Therefore, the answer is (C) 10 eV.",

If the free end of the longer wire is at an electric potential of 8.0 volts, and the free end of the shorter wire is at an electric potential of 1.0 volt, the potential at the junction of the two wires is most nearly equal to\n(A) 2.4 V (B) 3.3 V (C) 4.5 V (D) 5.7 V\nA: Let's think step by step. This is a simple voltage divider problem, where the longer wire has a resistance four times that of the shorter end. So the voltage divider ratio is 1 / 5, meaning that the potential in the middle is 1.0 V + (8.0 V - 1.0 V) * 1/5 = 2.4 V. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: A refracting telescope consists of two converging lenses separated by 100 cm. The eye-piece lens has a focal length of 20 cm. The angular magnification of the telescope is\n(A) 4 (B) 5 (C) 6 (D) 20\nA: Let's think step by step. In a refracting telescope, if both lenses are converging, the focus of both lenses must be between the two lenses, and thus the focal lengths of the two lenses must add up to their separation. Since the focal length of one lens is 20 cm, the focal length of the other must be 80 cm. The magnification is the ratio of these two focal lengths, or 4. The answer is (A).\n\nQ: For which of the following thermodynamic processes is the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas equal to the heat added to the gas?\n(A) Constant temperature (B) Constant volume (C) Constant pressure (D) Adiabatic\nA: Let's think step by step. Heat added to the gas can go into the gases internal energy or work done against an external force. However, if the volume of the gas container is constant, no work will be done (since work is pressure times change in volume). So, at constant volume, all of the heat goes into the internal energy.
