The question asks for the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q.\n2. The question belongs to the topic of field extensions in abstract algebra.\n3. Knowledge of field extensions, degrees of field extensions, and properties of square roots are commonly used to solve questions in this category.\n4. The most suitable method to solve this question is to determine the minimal polynomial of the given field extension over Q and find its degree.\n5. Let's consider each radical extension one by one:\n   - The minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x^2 - 2 which is irreducible over Q.\n   - The minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q is x^2 - 3 which is also irreducible over Q.\n   - The minimal polynomial of sqrt(18) over Q is x^2 - 18 = x^2 - 2 * 3 = (x - sqrt(2) * sqrt(3))(x + sqrt(2) * sqrt(3)).\n   \n   Therefore, the minimal polynomial of the given field extension over Q is the product of the minimal polynomials of each radical extension, which is (x^2 - 2)(x^2 - 3) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 6.\n   \n   The degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q is the degree of this minimal polynomial, which is 4.\n   \n6.

The question is asking for the index of a permutation in the symmetric group S_5. \n2. This question belongs to the category of group theory and specifically permutation groups. \n3. To solve this question, we can use the concept of cycle decomposition and calculating the order of a permutation. \n4. The most suitable method to solve this question is to find the cycle decomposition of the permutation p and then calculate its order. \n5. Since p = (1, 2, 5, 4)(2, 3), we can see that p has two cycles of length 4 and 2. Therefore, the order of p is lcm(4, 2) = 4. The index of <p> in S_5 is 5!/4 = 5. \n6.
