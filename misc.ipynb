      "Cars are a main aspect in our daily lives, but how would it be if we limited car usage throughout the world? Places would be more environmentally friendly and the streets would be less congested. So why not give it a shot, what could possibly go wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "If we limited car usage, it would be easier to get to our destination. Places would be more compact with less space for parking so that stores would be built close enough for us to walk there rather than driving to the nearest mall. Less malls would mean less parking lots, meaning sotres would be built along main streets rather than a highway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only does less cars make it easier to get to the places we need to be, but makes people happier. In the article \"In German Suburb, Life Goes on Without Cars\" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, Vauban, a city in Germany, limited car usage making their streets \"car-free\". Making streets car-free made people way happier, since they are usually tensed when having a car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limiting car usage would help the environment. Did you know that passenger cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some car-intensive areas in the United States? Imagine how polluted it must be in New York where the main streets are congested with cars!\n",
      "\n",
      "In the article \"Paris bans driving due to smog\" by Robert Duffer, Paris bans driving to clear the air. Congestion was down 60% in France. France has a tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesel makes up 67% of vehicles in France which pollutes the air big time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you rather live in a world full of polluted air and congested streets rather than walking or biking to places way closer and saving the earth at the same time? You decide.            \n",

      "Intoduction\n",
      "\n",
      "Luke had turned 18 before he arrived in Greece, he said\" I could be drafted for military services\" ( paragraph 4). It took Luke to get across the Atlantic Ocean eastern coast of the United States 2 weeks, and 1 month to get to China. Luke had made a least 9 trips, more than any Seagoing cowboy. By the time it was 1947 Luke had helped people he said \" Besides helping people, I had the side benefit of seeing Europe and China\" ( paragraph 5). Luke had visited Venice,Italy he rode a gondola because the streets were water. He also \" took a tour in a excavated castle in Crete, and the Panama Canalon his way to China\" (paragraph 5).\n",
      "\n",
      "Reasons A few reasons why you should to join the program that Luke is in because 1: he is a night watchman. That seems exicting because he gets to watch over the animal.2: he got to to visit a whole lot of places like Venice, Europe, China, and the Panama Canal. 3: he was on a boat so he got to visit the places like Europe and China. The last reason is to keep himself busy is caring for the animals during th crossing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Body What Luke likes about being Seagoing Cowboys is he metioned that this would be an opportunity of a lifetime. When he first got on the boat he was exicted to visit the coolest places. The First one he visited was Greece that was the place they headed first. Then it was Europe that was where the boat was headed toward. Venice it is last he said \" So was taking a godola ride in Venice, Italy, acity with streets of water.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion They are so manythings that Luke learned that ws really acurate of being a night watchman. Like helping people benefit of seeing Europe and China. Going through new expirence places like Europe, China, Veince,Italy. I am sure he probably visited more but, who knows. Luke learned that they'res a lot to handle of being a military watchman. The opportunity of a lifetime if he didn't take who knows of what could've happened to his life after he took the opportunity I am also sure he said hello to my New Life.\n",

When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters these tiny particles.\\n2. The shorter (blue) wavelengths of light are scattered more than the longer (red) wavelengths because they have a stronger interaction with the particles. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\\n3. As a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all directions.\\n4. Our brains perceive this scattered blue light as the color we know as blue.\\n\\nOther factors can influence the apparent blue color of the sky:\\n\\n* Time of day: During sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays have to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, scattering off more particles and taking on a more orange or red hue.\\n* Atmospheric conditions: Dust, pollution, and water vapor in the air can scatter light differently, making the sky appear more hazy or gray.\\n* Altitude: At higher elevations, the air is thinner, and there are fewer particles to scatter the light, resulting in a deeper blue color.\\n\\nSo, to summarize, the sky appears blue because of the scattering of sunlight by tiny particles in the atmosphere, with shorter wavelengths like blue being scattered more than longer wavelengths like red.\"},\n",

These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\\n3. **Scattering**: When sunlight hits these gas molecules, they scatter the shorter (blue) wavelengths more efficiently than the longer (red) wavelengths. This is because the small molecule size allows them to deflect the shorter wavelengths more effectively.\\n4. **Blue dominance**: As a result of this scattering, the blue light is distributed throughout the atmosphere in all directions, reaching our eyes from all parts of the sky. Since we see the sky as a whole, the combined effect is that it appears blue.\\n\\nOther factors can influence the apparent color of the sky:\\n\\n* **Dust and pollutants**: Tiny particles in the air can scatter longer wavelengths like red and orange light more effectively, making the sky appear more hazy or yellowish.\\n* **Clouds**: Clouds can reflect and scatter sunlight, changing the apparent color of the sky.\\n* **Atmospheric conditions**: Changes in temperature, humidity, and pressure can alter the scattering patterns, leading to variations in the sky's color.\\n\\nSo, there you have it!
